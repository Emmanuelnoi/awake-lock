## Migration Guide

### From v1.1.0 to v1.2.0

#### No Breaking Changes
This is a minor version update focused on performance and compatibility improvements. All existing APIs remain unchanged.

#### Performance Benefits
- **Automatic**: Your bundle size will be reduced by 59% after updating
- **Modern APIs**: Deprecation warnings will disappear automatically
- **Better Compatibility**: Enhanced browser support with modern event handling

#### Recommended Actions
1. Update your package: `npm update awake-lock` or `pnpm update awake-lock`
2. Rebuild your application to benefit from size optimizations
3. No code changes required - all improvements are automatic

#### Verification
After updating, you can verify the improvements:
```bash
# Check bundle size (should be ~25KB for UMD)
ls -la node_modules/awake-lock/dist/umd/

# Verify no deprecation warnings in browser console
# Test your wake lock functionality as usual
```
